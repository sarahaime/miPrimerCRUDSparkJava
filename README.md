## Project: miPrimerCRUDSparkJava

This project demonstrates the use of the SparkJava library for handling HTTP requests and responses, as well as template usage in a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application. 

### Overview

**miPrimerCRUDSparkJava** is designed to help developers understand the basics of building web applications using SparkJava, a lightweight Java web framework. This project includes examples of how to set up routes, manage data, and render templates.

### Features

- **HTTP Request Handling**: Demonstrates how to handle GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
- **CRUD Operations**: Implements basic CRUD functionalities for managing data.
- **Template Rendering**: Utilizes templates to render HTML views dynamically.
- **Simple Structure**: Easy to understand and modify, making it suitable for beginners.

### Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
- Gradle (for building the project)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sarahaime/miPrimerCRUDSparkJava.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd miPrimerCRUDSparkJava
   ```

3. **Build the Project**:
   Use Gradle to build the project:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   Start the application using:

   ```

### Usage

- Once the application is running, you can access it via your web browser at `http://localhost:4567`.
- Use the provided endpoints to perform CRUD operations. The endpoints and their functionalities will be defined in the code.

### Directory Structure

- `src/main`: Contains the main application code.
- `build.gradle`: The Gradle build file.
- `.gradlew`: The Gradle wrapper to execute commands without requiring a local Gradle installation.
